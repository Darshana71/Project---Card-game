# Project---Card-game

# Introduction
This is a multiplayer card game created with sockets and pygame.

# Game rules:
Each player is dealt 3(can be changed acc to convenience) cards. A "pot card" is chosen at random from the remaining deck of cards, and the game starts.
Each player chooses a card from the deck or "throws in" one card related to the pot card (having the same card suit or value) taking turns.
The player who throws in all his cards the fastest wins.


# Basic idea:
The game is created based on the client-server model provided by socket modules, and the graphics are done with the help of pygame. Despite being a slow programming language, the varied modules, packages and libraries provided by Python make it an easy go-to reference for basic application development.
